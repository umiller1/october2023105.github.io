                        <p>
                            Today we'll be learning about
                            Lists, Images, and HTML Attributes.
                            We'll also finish our Drills from
                            yesterday.

                                Then, we have a review kahoot on Tags
                                and Elements.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then we'll do a demo on HTML Lists.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After a short break, we have a kahoot
                                on HTML Indentation
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then we have a demo on HTML
                                Images
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Following, we have a powerpoint
                                on HTML attributes and another
                                on Clean Code part 2.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We'll then spend the rest of
                                class on the Wiki Page 1
                                exercise.

                            — Cows have best friends and become

                            Cows with similar dispositions
                            gravitate toward one another,
                            forging a close relationship
                            in the process. This is essentially
                            cattle bonding as they tend to seek
                            out relationships with like-minded
                            individuals similar to humans.
