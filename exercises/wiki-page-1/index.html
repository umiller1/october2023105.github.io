            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also 
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup> 
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a 
            feature observed in some tree species, in which
            the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch 
            each other, instead forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> This is most 
            prevalent among trees of the same species, but 
            also occurs between trees of different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as 
            to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.
